# Machine Learning Autumn Assessment

This repository contains two main sections: **Tasks** and **Project**. The tasks and project descriptions are outlined in the Assessment document.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations and array handling.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.

## Tasks

The tasks are clearly outlined within the notebook with detailed comments and markdown explanations for each step completed. These tasks include:

1. **Downloading the Dataset**: Obtained the `abalone.csv` file and added it to the repository.
2. **Loading the Data**: Used the `read_csv()` function from Pandas to load the dataset.
3. **Variable Classification**: Discussed the classification of each variable in the dataset based on several criteria.
4. **Summary Statistics**: Displayed and explained key summary statistics for each variable.
5. **Data Visualization**: Presented and explained the most suitable plots for each variable.

## Project

The project involves analyzing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the Abalone dataset. This includes:

1. **Classification Algorithms**: Explanation and concept of various classification algorithms.
2. **KNN Algorithm Analysis**: Detailed summary statistics and plots illustrating the application of the KNN algorithm to the Abalone dataset.
